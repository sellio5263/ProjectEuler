# Scott Elliott's Python Solutions to Project Euler
This is a repository for my own record, and as an example of my personal project.  It contains all of my solutions to the Project Euler problems.
As such, the Solutions folder does contain documented examples of my problem strategies.  
**Please do not access this in line with the wishes of the Project Euler creators if you do not wish for the joy of solving these puzzles to be spoiled for you.**
<br>
You can also see scripts that I have written to help me test the project as a whole to ensure all solutions are correct, and to help test between different versions of a solution to tease out smaller differences in efficiency.  The Overall Script was taken from another online repository (although I now forget where), but has been modified on my own to suit my tastes.  The SolutionComparison script is entirely my own construction.  I'm happy for anyone else to use these to start their journey.

Here is a link to Project Euler, if this has intrigued you, I'd encourage you to take a stab at it: https://projecteuler.net/
